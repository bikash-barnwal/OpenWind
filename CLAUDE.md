# CLAUDE.md — Platform Engineering Context

Loaded automatically at the start of every session.
Detailed rules live in `.claude/rules/` and auto-load — see the index below. The two Phase
primers are the exception — see "Phase primers" near the bottom: load on demand, not automatic.

## What we are building

A modular, workflow-native business platform. Every module (CRM, helpdesk, HRMS,
reimbursements, etc.) is a configuration of three shared engines: Entity Engine,
Workflow Engine, Automation Engine. Modules are seed SQL + one-line stub index files —
no domain logic TypeScript in `modules/`.

Reference docs (read before starting work in a new area):

- `docs/architecture-brief.md` — full platform architecture
- `docs/decisions/ADR-001-multitenancy.md` — tenancy model and RLS
- `docs/decisions/ADR-002-workflow-engine.md` — state machine design
- `docs/decisions/ADR-003-field-validation.md` — entity validation
- `docs/decisions/ADR-004-config-first-module-design.md` — config-first module model; the
  ADR most directly relevant to module authoring decisions (zero TypeScript in
  `modules/` — read this before touching anything under `modules/`)
- `docs/decisions/ADR-005-module-optionality-and-tender.md` — `tender` module scope
  (`modules.category = 'optional'`); read before changing module category/auto-provisioning logic
- `docs/decisions/ADR-006-per-workflow-ownership-admin-model.md` — per-workflow ownership/admin
  model, including the accepted v1 gap (transition guards don't consult per-instance
  `__accessUsers` grants); read before touching workflow ownership or access-grant logic
- `docs/decisions/ADR-007-rls-workflow-config-tables.md` — RLS for entity_types/workflows/
  workflow_states/workflow_transitions; read before touching RLS policies on these four tables
  or `apps/worker/src/tenant-purge.ts`'s workflow-state/transition deletion path
- `docs/decisions/ADR-008-api-key-credential-lifecycle-hardening.md` — `api_key` audit/expiry/
  rotation/soft-revoke and the `scopes` re-shape; read before touching `api_keys` or Phase 3A
  connector/partner auth
- `docs/decisions/ADR-009-connector-runtime-webhook-gateway-architecture.md` — connector runtime,
  webhook gateway, outbound delivery; read before starting any Phase 3A connector work
- `docs/decisions/ADR-010-inbound-partner-api-integration.md` — inbound partner API (Tier 1
  only — Tier 2 deferred); read before touching the public/partner-facing API surface
- `docs/decisions/ADR-011-plugin-system.md` — plugin system (Module Federation, slot registry,
  lifecycle service); read before touching `packages/plugin-sdk` or plugin install/uninstall
  routes. Two known gaps tracked in the ADR itself (no wrapped DB client/governor limits wired,
  no plugin can run backend code yet — only migrations execute) — see issue #433.
- `docs/decisions/ADR-012-third-party-api-ticket-access.md` — third-party API access to tickets
  (dual-identity auth, action-scopes, presigned attachment uploads); read before touching the
  Phase A–G third-party API implementation (`docs/third-party-api-design.md` is the canonical
  behavioral detail). See issue #471 for a governance note on how this ADR was accepted.
- `docs/decisions/ADR-013-unified-rate-limiting-strategy.md` — platform-wide rate-limiting tiers
  (per-key-and-person / per-key / per-tenant); read before touching `packages/redis/src/rate-limit.ts`,
  `apps/api/src/middleware/rate-limit.ts`, or `packages/auth/src/middleware.ts`'s rate-limit checks.
- `docs/decisions/ADR-014-notification-sla-retry-escalation.md` — notification retry/exhaustion
  policy; read before touching `apps/worker/src/notification-*.ts` or `alert-worker.ts`.
- `docs/sup-docs/roadmap-tracker.md` — phase progress and track status
- `docs/sup-docs/week-log/` — running velocity log, one file per session (see its README —
  never edit `week-log.md` itself, it's frozen history as of 2026-08-13)

## Current focus

**Phase:** 3 — Scale & Extensibility (3A **in progress**, 3B **done** — ADR-008/009/010 accepted
2026-08-06; 3A Stage 0 + Stage 1 done, Stage 2 runtime + scopes tracks landing; 3B shipped
2026-08-13 via PR #397 (all 3 phases) — see `docs/sup-docs/roadmap-tracker.md` for the current %,
not repeated here since it drifts)
**Phase 2 status:** ✅ Complete as of 2026-06-18 (all 4 tracks + pre-pilot hardening merged)

Phase 3 tracks (3A in progress, 3B done, 3D done; 3E + 3F spec+design complete (ADRs pending); 3C/3-OPS still 0% — no active work yet; starting
either is a human scope call — no ADR exists for either yet — consistent with
`agent-behaviour.md`'s general "no phase advance without explicit sign-off" rule, not a
3C-specific one):

New findings from any review go through
[docs/reviews/pending-review-findings.md](docs/reviews/pending-review-findings.md) — file an
issue before picking one up, not a standing checklist in this file. (The pre-Phase-3 hardening
round and the 2026-07-16/21 reconciliation that used to be summarized here are both fully closed;
see `docs/sup-docs/week-log/2026-08-19-claude-md-hardening-checklist-archive.md` for that history
verbatim, and ADR-005/ADR-006 above for the decisions that came out of it.)

**Delivery has guardrails (Claude Code only; plain git + CI unaffected).** Every change runs
Plan → Code → Review → Docs → Ship: freeze + **you approve** an acceptance-criteria plan-lock
(`/spec-tasks` or the `openwind-loop` pick step) before editing source; all edits then one `/review`;
then docs are updated alongside the change (`write-docs-marker.sh --touched`) or the commit
explicitly records why this diff needs none (`--skip "<reason>"`) — no silent third option; the
commit procedure runs `typecheck+lint+test+test:isolation`, writes the commit marker, and opens a
structured PR. The hooks are **guardrails, not barricades** — best-effort speed bumps that catch
honest mistakes; they are not a security boundary (a determined agent can bypass them). The real
enforcement is CI + required human PR review + branch protection. See
[.claude/README.md](.claude/README.md) and [definition-of-done.md](.claude/references/definition-of-done.md).

**Off-limits (never touch autonomously):**

- Parallel approval code — off-limits regardless of Phase 3 progress; no track (3A/3B done,
  3C/3D unstarted) currently owns building this — see
  `.claude/context/parallel-approval-pattern.md` and issue #65
- ADR files in `docs/decisions/` — humans write these
- Schema cache / `redis.keys()` fix — deferred until load testing (issue #4)

  admin-ui/     Refine + shadcn/ui — single app serving both agent/admin and customer
                users (port 3001), RBAC-controlled internally. There is no separate
                portal app — `apps/portal` source was removed in PR #211; the directory
                exists only as a pnpm workspace stub.

## Dependency rule (enforced by ESLint — CI fails on violations)

```
apps/*             → packages/*
modules/*          → packages/*   (no cross-module imports ever)
entity-engine      → db only
workflow-engine    → db, entity-engine
automation-engine  → db, workflow-engine, entity-engine
teams              → db only     (3E on-call routing + 3F temporal scheduler shared
                                   cross-tenant FK helper — docs/specs/oncall-routing.md T44)
```

Cross-module communication: event bus, entity engine relations API, or tRPC only.

Same rule, also checkable on the full transitive graph (not just per-file import specifiers)
via `pnpm dep:check` — see `.claude/context/dependency-graph.md`.

## Commands

**Everything containerized — nothing runs on the host.** `docker compose up -d` starts the
default stack (Postgres, PgBouncer, Redis, OpenBao, Zitadel, ClamAV, `ow-backend`,
`ow-frontend`, and `ow-worker`) — this is the standard way to run the app, in dev and on
servers alike. Novu is opt-in via `--profile notifications` (`novu-api`/`novu-worker`/
`novu-web`/`novu-mongo`), and observability features are opt-in via `--profile observability` (`prometheus`/`grafana`/`alertmanager`/`otel-collector`) — a plain `up -d` does not start them. MinIO is fully commented out —
`packages/files` moved to local-disk storage + real ClamAV scanning (PR #340); MinIO is kept in
`docker-compose.yml` only as reference for a possible future return to object storage, nothing
reads from it today. `ow-worker` runs `apps/worker` (outbox poller, automation execution, SLA
scheduler, notifications, file cleanup, AV scan) as its own container, same as
`ow-backend`/`ow-frontend`. This was discovered missing on the first server deployment
(2026-07-25) — a plain `docker compose up -d` had never included it, so BullMQ jobs queued but
nothing ever consumed them.
`pnpm dev` (turbo, host-mode hot reload) still works for fast local iteration, but it runs
services directly on the host — it is not what CI or servers do, and using it as your only
local dev flow is how gaps like the missing worker container go unnoticed until production.
Prefer `docker compose up -d` unless you specifically need host-mode hot reload for a
tight edit-test loop.

```bash
docker compose up -d                          # default stack — Postgres, PgBouncer, Redis,
                                               # OpenBao, Zitadel, ClamAV, ow-backend/frontend/worker
docker compose --profile notifications up -d  # + Novu (novu-api/worker/web/mongo)
docker compose --profile observability up -d  # + Observability (prometheus/grafana/alertmanager/otel-collector)
pnpm dev              # host-mode hot reload (fast iteration only — see note above)
pnpm test             # unit + integration tests
pnpm test:isolation   # RLS isolation tests  (requires Docker/OrbStack stack)
pnpm test:e2e         # end-to-end API tests (requires Docker/OrbStack stack)
pnpm typecheck        # TypeScript check all packages
pnpm lint             # ESLint, max-warnings=0
pnpm db:migrate       # run pending migrations
pnpm db:seed          # seed development data
```

macOS: use OrbStack (not Docker Desktop). Windows: run isolation/e2e in CI or WSL2.

## When stuck

1. Check the relevant ADR in `docs/decisions/` — the decision and reasoning are there
2. Check existing tests — they document expected behavior precisely
3. Check `.claude/context/` for domain-specific guides (entity-engine.md, workflow-engine.md, automation-engine.md)
4. Need to know what depends on a file before changing it? `pnpm dep:impact -- '<path-regex>'`
   gives a transitive answer grep can't — but a stale `dist/` makes it silently
   under-report, so treat an empty result as inconclusive, not "nothing depends on this",
   and cross-check with grep before trusting it — see `.claude/context/dependency-graph.md`
5. Check `docs/sup-docs/roadmap-tracker.md` — understand the phase context before changing scope
6. If a decision isn't covered by an ADR, write one before implementing

## Maintenance notes

**Dep bumps:** All security override pins live in `pnpm-workspace.yaml`'s `overrides:` key
(moved from `package.json`'s `pnpm.overrides` field when pnpm was upgraded to v11 — that
field is no longer read). Do not remove these:

- `esbuild >=0.28.1` — GHSA-gv7w-rqvm-qjhr (high); tsx@4.x and vite@6.x pull in the
  vulnerable version transitively.
- `hono >=4.12.34` — GHSA-8j4g-w8fx-2239 (ReDoS in CORS middleware via
  Access-Control-Request-Headers). Also the source of truth for the minimum hono version
  workspace-wide (#182) — individual `package.json` hono specifiers should match this floor.
- `turbo >=2.9.14` — GHSA-3qcw-2rhx-2726 (unexpected local code execution during Yarn Berry
  detection).
- `"@babel/core" >=7.29.1` — GHSA-4x5r-pxfx-6jf8 (arbitrary file read via sourceMappingURL
  comment).
- `"brace-expansion" ">=5.0.9"` — GHSA-3jxr-9vmj-r5cp / GHSA-52cp-r559-cp3m /
  GHSA-mh99-v99m-4gvg (DoS via unbounded expansion); blanket pin covers all major lines.
  Bumped from `>=5.0.8` for GHSA-rgw5-rvv9-x895 (2026-08-03) — the 5.0.8 mitigation only
  bounded the final combine() step, not two intermediate arrays built before it.
- `"js-yaml@4" "4.3.1"` — quadratic CPU via merge-key chains (>=4.0.0 <4.3.0) and
  `!!omap` tag resolution (GHSA-5p4m-2wfm-xmqj / CVE-2026-59870, 2026-08-07);
  bumped from `4.3.0` on 2026-08-07.
- `"fast-uri" ">=3.1.4 <4.0.0 || >=4.1.2"` — GHSA-4c8g-83qw-93j6 / GHSA-v2hh-gcrm-f6hx /
  GHSA-7p8r-x3mc-p8w7 (host confusion via IDN / backslash authority); pulled in via
  commitlint's ajv dep. Range widened from a flat `>=3.1.4` floor to also patch the 4.x line
  once GHSA-7p8r-x3mc-p8w7 landed there too.
- `undici ">=7.29.0 <8"` — GHSA-4cwx-7wf7-3272 / GHSA-m8rv-5g2x-5cg5 / GHSA-jr45-8vmc-qm54 /
  GHSA-v3r7-h72x-cjcm; bounded to `<8` so a major bump doesn't break jsdom's internal file
  imports.
- `postcss ">=8.5.23"` — GHSA-r28c-9q8g-f849 (path traversal via sourceMappingURL
  auto-loading) + GHSA-fxqj-rqcc-2cmp (second path traversal variant, bumped from
  `>=8.5.18` to `>=8.5.23` to close it); pulled in via vite (admin-ui devDep).
- `nanoid ">=3.3.17 <4"` — GHSA-2v37-7h3g-55p8 (indefinite loop when size is 0);
  pulled in via postcss (vite/vitest chains in admin-ui devDeps). Bounded to `<4` —
  postcss's own package.json pins nanoid as `^3.x`, so an unbounded floor would
  silently force it onto an untested major (resolves to 6.0.1) instead of just the fix.
- `qs ">=6.15.2"` — GHSA-q8mj-m7cp-5q26 (qs.stringify crashes on null/undefined entries in
  comma-format arrays with encodeValuesOnly); pulled in via @refinedev/core and
  @refinedev/react-router-v6 (admin-ui dependencies).
- `react-router ">=6.30.4 <7"` — GHSA-2j2x-hqr9-3h42 (open redirect in 6.x); bounded
  to `<7` — react-router 7 has breaking API changes; the two open-redirect advisories that
  require `>=7.18.0` (GHSA-wrjc-x8rr-h8h6 / GHSA-337j-9hxr-rhxg) are deferred until a
  coordinated v7 upgrade.
- `react-router-dom ">=6.30.5 <7"` — GHSA-jjmj-jmhj-qwj2 (open redirect → XSS in
  6.30.2–6.30.4); bounded to `<7` for the same reason as react-router above.
- `"@remix-run/router" ">=1.23.3"` — GHSA-2j2x-hqr9-3h42 (same advisory; this is the
  internal peer pulled in by react-router and react-router-dom).
- `"@hono/node-server" ">=2.0.10"` — GHSA-frvp-7c67-39w9 (path traversal via encoded
  backslash on Windows in serve-static) + GHSA-9mqv-5hh9-4cgg (memory-leak DoS via aborted
  WebSocket handshake); pulled in by apps/api, apps/worker, packages/auth.
- `browserslist ">=4.28.7"` — GHSA-c83g-rgw3-j3cx (unbounded memory growth) +
  GHSA-73wf-gq98-2v4g (prototype write via normalizeStats); pulled in via
  @vitejs/plugin-react → @babel/core → @babel/helper-compilation-targets.

**Deferred overrides (require major-version coordination before adding):**

- `uuid` GHSA-w5hq-g745-h8pq (buffer bounds check in v3/v5/v6 when `buf` is provided):
  fix requires `>=11.1.1` but `exceljs` pins `uuid@8.x` internally — uuid 11 dropped
  CommonJS and changed APIs, so a forced override would break exceljs at runtime. Revisit
  when exceljs ships native uuid-v11 support.
- `@opentelemetry/core` GHSA-8988-4f7v-96qf (unbounded memory in W3C Baggage propagation):
  fix requires `>=2.8.0` but current version is `1.30.1` — a 1→2 major bump; `@sentry/node`
  and all OTel instrumentation packages in `packages/telemetry` are pinned to the 1.x API
  and are not yet compatible with OTel core 2.x. Revisit when Sentry releases a 2.x-compatible
  SDK version.

## Phase primers (load on demand — not imported automatically)

Unlike the rest of this file, these are not read every session — pull the relevant one in only
when the work actually touches that phase, so sessions on unrelated tracks don't pay for content
they won't use.

- Working on Phase 2 legacy surfaces (helpdesk/reimbursements/CRM modules, platform services,
  admin-ui generic views, no-code builders)? Read `.claude/context/phase-2-primer.md` first.
- Working on Phase 3A or later Phase 3 tracks (connector runtime, webhook gateway, `api_keys`,
  `event_subscriptions`, `packages/connector-sdk`)? Read `.claude/context/phase-3-primer.md` first.
